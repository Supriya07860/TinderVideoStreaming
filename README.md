This React Native code creates a video-swiping app where users can swipe left or right through a list of videos, similar to Tinder. Here's a brief breakdown:

1.Imports: Brings in libraries for UI elements, gestures (swiping), and video playback using Expo.
2.State/Refs: Manages the current video index and swipe position using useState and useRef.
3.Videos Array: Contains video URLs with additional info like username, description, and likes.
4.Swipe Functionality:
    PanResponder listens for swipe gestures.
    When a swipe is detected, the video card animates left or right.
    Based on the swipe, the next video is displayed.
5.Rendering:
    Top/Bottom Bar: Displays icons for settings and actions (like/dislike).
    Video & Info: Shows the current video and user info (username, likes, description).
    Swipes animate the videos, and users can reset to the first video if they reach the end.
